# Harmoniq

## Business Case

### Opportunity

Harmoniq has an opportunity to continue building its already-profitable brand. Our well-known support for Artists can be enhanced further by either offering live music ticketing, an online vinyl record store, or online merchandise store.

This business case examines the feasibility, risks and strategic benefits of these three options and recommends the implementation of one of them. 

### Solution

After a thorough analysis of each proposed solution, this business case recommends creating live music ticketing functionality within our already-successful music service due to its alignment with our brand in terms of supporting Artists, lower initial investment impact and superior integration with existing systems.

The live music industry is experiencing strong growth, with increased ticket sales and revenue streams. Over 20 million people attended a gig or concert in 2023. We should support our Artists in this growth and offer them opportunities to use our platform to enhance ticket sales, deepening our brand's values of supporting Artists.

### Approach

Our solution is based on our analysis of several documents (see appendices):

- Stakeholder Analysis to understand the market and the demographics which will affect the outcome of the project.
- Google Trends Analysis to understand more broadly the trends in terms of Google searches for each of the proposed solutions. In turn this provides a forecast for potential revenue streams for each solution.
- Decision Matrix to prioritise which solution is the best fit for Harmoniq.
- Risk Analysis to deeply understand the potential pitfalls and mitigation strategies in order to avoid them. 

### Trends

Drawing from our Trends appendix (see appendices), searches for "live music" remain consistently high throughout the twelve month period. This suggests that demand for live music events isn't directly related to seasonal trends, offering a consistent and stable revenue opportunity for Harmoniq. Conversely, searches for "vinyl records" and "merchandise" experience strong peaks over the Christmas period and dramatically fell to well below the level of "live music" searches thereafter, suggesting a seasonal trend and less stable revenue forecasting ability. 

### Risk Assessment

Our highest priority risks are detailed here and how we plan to mitigate against them:

| Risk                  | Mitigation                                                |
| ---                   | ---                                                       |
| Ticket Fraud          | By implementing an identity verification feature and generating unique QR codes reduces this risk severely.                                                |
| Financial Risk        | Implement fraud detection systems and clear refund policies. In addition, a clear marketing strategy that targets users of the app, social media and legacy media, we can be sure to encourage ticket sales and use of the new feature.                |
| Data Breaches         | By aligning our new ticketing feature with current end-to-end encryption and 2FA functionality, we should lessen this risk and its possible impact on business performance. |

### Projected Revenue Growth

Having studied live ticket sales revenue data from [The Economics Observatory](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/live-music-in-the-uk-whats-the-state-of-the-industry#:~:text=In%20aggregate%2C%20consumers%20spent%20%C2%A3,in%20and%20around%20the%20event.), we can confidently expect the revenue growth forecast as detailed below given a 35% uptake of ticket sales via our platform by Artists:

| Month  | Current Revenue Growth    | Forecast Revenue Growth |
| ---    | ---                       | ---                     |
| 1      | 3% year-on-year           | 3% year-on-year due to platform being built |
| 2      | 3.5% year-on-year         | 4% year-on-year as feature launches         |
| 3      | 3.5% year-on-year         | 5% year-on-year as customers gain confidence in the plaform |

### Milestones

### Conclusion

We recommend the implementation of a live music ticketing feature for our already-successful platform. In aggregate, consumers spent Â£6.1 billion going to gigs, festivals & club nights in the UK last year - a 35% increase from pre-pandemic levels ([The Econoics Observatory](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/live-music-in-the-uk-whats-the-state-of-the-industry#:~:text=In%20aggregate%2C%20consumers%20spent%20%C2%A3,in%20and%20around%20the%20event.)). 

This opportunity should be exploited and our value of supporting emerging Artists lends well to the creation of the ticketing feature.
