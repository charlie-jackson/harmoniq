The above stakeholder analysis observes the stakeholders for Harmoniq's application currently (green), and those who would become stakeholders after implementation (yellow). The 'Actively Engaged' and 'Keep Satisfied' stakeholders need to be satisfied, otherwise have status to implement their desired changes. This places them quite high in the thought of consideration to implementing change for the goal in branching out into other service lines.
