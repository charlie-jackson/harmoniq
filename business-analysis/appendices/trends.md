## Google Trends relating to the three proposed solutions

In order to add context to our proposed solution, the following data from Google Trends will be used to inform our deicision. 

To calculate the Trends, we searched for each given term and set the length criteria to 12 months, indicating how often each given term was searched for over a 12 month period. 

With a maximum score of 100, each search criteria is marked against the same metrics. 

The outcome is that the search term "Live Music" ranked consistently highest throughout the 12 months to date, lending weight to the solution of offering live music tickets for artists, over offering an online record store or merchandise store solutions.

### "Live Music"

### "Vinyl Records"

The search term "vinyl records" has a relatively dramatic search curve ranging from 47 to 100 over the course of 12 months. This chart indicates that this search term is seasonal, increasing near and peaking over the Christmas season. This volatility should be taken into account when choosing the solution.

### "Merchandise"

In a similar way to the "vinyl records" search trends chart, "merchandise" seearches seem to be seasonsal, also peaking around the Christmas season before tailing off quite dramatically. Search term interest otherwise seems to remain consistent around the 50 mark.
